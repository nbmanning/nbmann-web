I'm currently a graduate student at the [Center for Systems Integration & Sustainability](https://www.canr.msu.edu/csis/) at Michigan State University. In an interconnected world, things in one place can have rippling effects on places across the globe. I study the impact of natural disasters in one region on international deforestation using images taken from space. interested in using earth observation data to study changes in environmental systems. Currently, I am examining the impacts of natural disasters in one region on how land is used in a distant region. Metacoupling (link) provides a way to view socioeconomic and environmental changes between and across systems, and is the driving theory for my research.

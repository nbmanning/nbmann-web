intro: I'm interested in using earth observation data to study changes in environmental systems. Currently, I am examining the impacts of natural disasters in one region on how land is used in a distant region. Metacoupling (link) provides a way to view socioeconomic and environmental changes between and across systems, and is the driving theory for my research.
